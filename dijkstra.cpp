/**
   paths vector constantly constains the DISTANCE and PREDECESSOR for the path from source
   to de ith node in the secure zone (invariant of Dijkstra's algorithm).

   In the beginning of the algorithm, the paths from source to all nodes are considered as infinity.
   Since, at the beginning the secure zone is just the source node, source to all nodes are just the
   same source node (obviously).

   Q is the priority queue (using a Fibonacci Heap implementati√≥n of mine) that we
   use to select the node which minimizes the distance to the secure zone.
   Using a Fibonacci heap implementation for the priority queue, we get the
   best asymptotical running time of Dijkstra! :)
